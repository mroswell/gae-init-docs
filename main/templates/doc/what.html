    If you have some experience already building web applications, you are aware of
    the fact that there are some common tasks you have to do before you get started.
    You have to set up a project with a file structure, grab the latest libraries,
    copy usefull code snippets from old projects, or rewrite them, set up a sign-in
    mechanism and other repeated boring stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project solves exactly that problem. It comes with
    the most common stuff that you need in order to create a modern web application.
    No more wasted time on dealing with tools and configurations.
    You can start working on your next big thing, right away!

    <strong>gae-init</strong> is always up to date with the latest
    libraries and following the best programming practices. Do you like it clean?
    We love it! We religiously follow coding conventions for clarity and consistency.
