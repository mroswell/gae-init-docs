#### Why do I need Node.js?

To install some 3rd party dependences like compiling, minifying and more.
Don't worry, they are all installed inside the project's directory.

#### Why Gulp?

Because if you are web developer you either have it already or you might have
Grunt. Well we tried both and it looks like Gulp is faster and more efficient.

#### Why CoffeeScript?

Because it rocks!

#### Can I just use JavaScript instead of CoffeeScript?

Yes.

#### Why Less?

Because it rocks as well!

#### Can I use CSS instead of Less?

Yes.

#### Can I use SASS instead of Less or CSS?

Yes, it will require some work, but is very doable.

#### It rocks, but I still don't get it. Can you help me?
